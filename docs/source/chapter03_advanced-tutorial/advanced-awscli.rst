More advanced usages of AWSCLI
==============================

Besides accessing S3, AWSCLI can control any kinds of AWS resources you can imagine. A very useful one is ``aws ec2 run-instances`` (`official doc <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html>`_) , as it saves a lot of time clicking through the console.

While ``aws s3 xxx`` are often used on EC2 instances to interact with S3, ``aws ec2 xxx`` are mostly used on local computers to control remote servers.

Launch on-demand instances
--------------------------

Use this bash script to launch an on-demand instance::

  #!/bin/bash
  
  # == often change ==
  TYPE=r4.large   # EC2 instance type

  # ==  set it once and seldom change ==
  AMI=ami-xxxxxxx # AMI to launch from
  SG=sg-xxxxxxxx  # security group ID
  KEY=xxx-key     # EC2 key pair name
  COUNT=1         # how many instances to launch
  IAM=xxxxx       # EC2 IAM role name
  EBS_SIZE=200    # root EBS volume size (GB)

  # == almost never change; just leave it as-is ==
  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id $AMI \
      --security-group-ids $SG --count $COUNT \
      --instance-type $TYPE --key-name $KEY \
      --iam-instance-profile Name=$IAM \
      --block-device-mapping DeviceName=/dev/sda1,Ebs={VolumeSize=$EBS_SIZE}

- **TYPE**: `EC2 instance type <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>`_.
- **AMI**: The AMI you want to launch from, such as :doc:`our tutorial AMI <../chapter06_appendix/aws-resources-for-gc>`.
- **SG**: The :doc:`security group <../chapter02_beginner-tutorial/security-group>` you want to assign to your EC2 instance.
- **KEY**: The EC2 Key Pair for ``ssh``. For example, in the quick start demo I used :ref:`my-aws-key <keypair-label>`.
- **COUNT**: You can launch multiple instances with exactly the same configurations
- **IAM**: The :doc:`IAM role <./iam-role>` for your EC2 instance. Primarily for granting S3 access.
- **EBS_SIZE**: The size of disk (:doc:`EBS volume <../chapter02_beginner-tutorial/use-ebs>`).

Request spot instances
----------------------

For spot instances, simply add ``--instance-market-options '{"MarketType":"spot"}`` option to ``aws ec2 run-instances``. Other options are exactly the same as the on-demand case::

  #!/bin/bash

  # == often change ==
  TYPE=c5.4xlarge  # EC2 instance type

  # ==  set it once and seldom change ==
  AMI=ami-xxxxxxx # AMI to launch from
  SG=sg-xxxxxxxx  # security group ID
  KEY=xxx-key     # EC2 key pair name
  COUNT=1         # how many instances to launch
  IAM=xxxxx       # EC2 IAM role name
  EBS_SIZE=200    # root EBS volume size (GB)

  # == almost never change; just leave it as-is ==
  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id $AMI \
      --security-group-ids $SG --count $COUNT \
      --instance-type $TYPE --key-name $KEY \
      --iam-instance-profile Name=$IAM \
      --block-device-mapping DeviceName=/dev/sda1,Ebs={VolumeSize=$EBS_SIZE} \
      --instance-market-options '{"MarketType":"spot"}'

By default, the `on-demand pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/>`_ will be used as the spot price limit. You can further set a custom limit (generally not necessary)::

  --instance-market-options '{"MarketType":"spot", "SpotOptions": {"MaxPrice": "0.68"}}'

The command ``aws ec2 request-spot-instances`` (`doc <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/request-spot-instances.html>`_) can also launch spot instances, but its syntax is slightly more complicated.

Other use cases
---------------

You may also `describe EC2 instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html>`_
or `stop EC2 instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.html>`_ using AWSCLI. But it is very quick to do so from the console, too.
