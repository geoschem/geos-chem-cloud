Building an MPI cluster from scratch
=====================================

Although there are many :ref:`HPC cluster tools <hpc-overview-label>` that can create an MPI cluster with a single command, at development stage it is better to glue an MPI cluster manually from scratch. This allows you to test arbitrary architecture and libraries, and also help understand how the cluster tools work under the hood.

More details coming soon...
